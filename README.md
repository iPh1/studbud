# Self-Reflection
Wow! That was an absolute blast to create! This unit has definitely taken me for a rollercoaster of a ride, where I've learnt (the hard way) a lot of programming along the way, all the way from Javascript, to debugging code, to crying, then Googling and getting that lightbulb! moment. As you may have (or have not) seen, my A3 Web Protype was a major 180 degree flip from my proposal, submitted earlier. Frankly, I feel like that standard to which the A2: Web Proposal set out by me was too low, and not a proper reflection of my capabilities. As such, from A2 to the final hours of A3, I set out to **really** create a proper, functioning web app prototype, that not only you as a marker would be pleased with, but something that future me would be too as well (and hopefully the employer, down the line, too of course). Some features that were still kept from A2, was the Task-list, Music Player, Pomodoro and the Kanban board. Other new-comers that were introduced were the Timer, and the Acroynm Maker. All and all, it was a pleasure and personal accomplishment to code this largely from scratch, to learn with Rob and the Tutors along the way, and to finally be able to present a web app that I am very very proud off. :)
